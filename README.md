A more PC version of an old classic

## Instructions
Two-player game that cycles through two rounds. In each round, both players get a turn to guess a word or phrase and also create a word or phrase for their opponent to guess. Points are scored to active player or opponent based on correct and incorrect letter choices. A player can make five incorrect guesses before losing a puzzle. Solving a puzzle gives the solver 200 points, while losing that puzzle gives the opponent 200 points. After two rounds the player with the highest score is determined as the winner.

## Technologies Used

This game was designed using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and jQuery.
Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
No installation necessary. Live on https://mikehoods.github.io/notHangman/ Designed to play in your web browser on mobile, laptop, or desktop devices.

## Approach Taken

Developed in just a few days for General Assembly SEIR-Nova Project 1. Built step-by-step via HTML, JS, and CSS. All gameplay occurs via DOM. Assignment specified a two-player requirement, but this could be adapted for one-player given more time.
